# simple-math
A (not-faithful) re-implementation of [this Python simple math](https://github.com/waiyaki/time-capsule/blob/master/AIMath/AI_Math_DB_py3.py) project in Clojure, as part of an effort to learn Clojure.


Additionally, this repo uses lots of small commits that follow the Angular commit guidelines in an attempt to explore how conventional commits can be used for changelog generation in Clojure projects.


## Usage
Run the application using

``` shell
clj -m simple-math.core
```
